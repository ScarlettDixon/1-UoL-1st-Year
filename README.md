Student ID: 16602092

**Modules Taken:**

Problem Solving -  Talks about the nature of asking and answering questions and how to think outside the box. Assessment involved splitting into groups and solving semi-impossible questions by using taught techniques
Exams/In Class tests given with no producable artifact.

---
Operating Systems - Initially involved lectures on the history of OSs, then discussed their inner functions and abilities with special looks at the windows command line and Linux terminal, producing bash scripts.
Exams/In Class tests given with no producable artifact.
 
---
Computer Architectures - Given as a module to understand binary and then how it can be converted into usable computer code, involved several workshops where LogicSim and MarieSim were used to teach assembly.
Exams/In Class tests given with no producable artifact.

---
Programming and Data Structures - As the name suggests, this module was taught in the first semester and contained information on how programming languages work and also the key data structures that are used within. 
Assessment 1 included analysis of keyboard and text file input and before being parsed through a sentiment function, determining how positive or negative the input is.
Assessment 2 built onto the previous task with creating a dice game, the rules of the game are fairly difficult to sumarise succinctly, but the aim was to use and understand different data structures to complete the task.

---
Algorithms and Complexity - Again the name of this module is quite self explanatory, the main focus was on getting us to think about and then develop methods to increase efficiency in processing, weighing the pros and cons of smaller time or space complexity. The Assessment involved taking two datasets containing weather data, we were tasked with efficiently sorting or searching this data based on different factors e.g.month or city in which the data was recorded.

---
Web Authoring -  Discussion on the structures of HTML, CSS, Javascripts and Jquery infused with design theory.
Assessment artifact involved developing a website for selling vehicles with extra marks for correctly implimented.

---
Mathematics for Computing -  Understanding key math concepts including matrices, derivatives and integrals. 
Exams/In Class tests given with no producable artifact.
